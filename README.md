## Testing
Describe: wordCounter()

Test: "It should return 1 if a passage has just one word."
Code:
const text = "hello";
wordCounter(text);
Expected Output: 1

Test: "It should return 2 if a passage has two words."
Code:
const text = "hello there";
wordCounter(text);
Expected Output: 2

## Another testing
Describe: numberOfOccurrencesInText()

Test: "It should return 0 occurrences of a word for an empty string."
Code:
const text = "";
const word = "red";
numberOfOccurrencesInText(word, text);
Expected Output: 0

Test: "It should return 1 occurrence of a word when the word and the text are the same."
Code:
const text = "red";
const word = "red";
numberOfOccurrencesInText(word, text);
Expected Output: 1

Test: "It should return 0 occurrences of a word when the word and the text are different."
Code:
const text = "red";
const word = "blue";
numberOfOccurrencesInText(word, text);
Expected Output: 0

Test: "It should return the number of occurrences of a word."
Code:
const text = "red blue red red red green";
const word = "red";
numberOfOccurrencesInText(word, text);
Expected Output: 4

Describe: numberOfOccurrencesInText()

<-- this is our first test -->
Test: "It should return 0 occurrences of a word for an empty string."
Code:
const text = "";
const word = "red";
numberOfOccurrencesInText(word, text);
Expected Output: 0

Test: "It should return a word match regardless of case."
Code:
const text = "red RED Red green Green GREEN";
const word = "Red";
numberOfOccurrencesInText(word, text);
Expected Output: 3

#### Our Sixth Test
Test: "It should return a word match regardless of punctuation."
Code:
const text = "Red! Red. I like red, green, and yellow.";
const word = "Red";
numberOfOccurrencesInText(word, text);
Expected Output: 3
