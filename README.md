## Description
_Setting Up the "Text Analyzer" Example Project,
Test-Driven Development: Part 2_

## Testing 1:
Describe: wordCounter()

Test: "It should return 1 if a passage has just one word."
Code:
const text = "hello";
wordCounter(text);
Expected Output: 1

Test: "It should return 2 if a passage has two words."
Code:
const text = "hello there";
wordCounter(text);
Expected Output: 2

## Testing 2:
### Describe: numberOfOccurrencesInText()

Test: "It should return 0 occurrences of a word for an empty string."
Code:
const text = "";
const word = "red";
numberOfOccurrencesInText(word, text);
Expected Output: 0

Test: "It should return 1 occurrence of a word when the word and the text are the same."
Code:
const text = "red";
const word = "red";
numberOfOccurrencesInText(word, text);
Expected Output: 1

Test: "It should return 0 occurrences of a word when the word and the text are different."
Code:
const text = "red";
const word = "blue";
numberOfOccurrencesInText(word, text);
Expected Output: 0

Test: "It should return the number of occurrences of a word."
Code:
const text = "red blue red red red green";
const word = "red";
numberOfOccurrencesInText(word, text);
Expected Output: 4

### Describe: numberOfOccurrencesInText()

<-- this is our first test -->
Test: "It should return 0 occurrences of a word for an empty string."
Code:
const text = "";
const word = "red";
numberOfOccurrencesInText(word, text);
Expected Output: 0

Test: "It should return a word match regardless of case."
Code:
const text = "red RED Red green Green GREEN";
const word = "Red";
numberOfOccurrencesInText(word, text);
Expected Output: 3

#### Our Sixth Test
Test: "It should return a word match regardless of punctuation."
Code:
const text = "Red! Red. I like red, green, and yellow.";
const word = "Red";
numberOfOccurrencesInText(word, text);
Expected Output: 3

Test: "If an empty string is passed in as a word, it should return 0."
Code:
const word = "";
const text = "red RED Red!";
wordCounter(word, text);
Expected Output: 0

### Test 3:
Describe: boldPassage()

Test: "It should return a non-matching word in a p tag."
Code:
const word = "hello";
const text = "yo";
boldPassage(word, text);
Expected Output: "<p>yo</p>"

Test: "It should return a matching word in a b tag."
Code:
const word = "hello";
const text = "hello";
boldPassage(word, text);
Expected Output: "<p><b>hello</b></p>"

Test: "It should wrap words that match in `b` tags but not words that don't."
Code:
const word = "hello";
const text = "hello there";
boldPassage(word, text);
Expected Output: "<p><b>hello</b> there</p>"
